# Data Storage

Use the `data/` folder to separate raw inputs from derived tables:

- `data/raw/surveys/` → questionnaires, transcripts or exports that should never be edited
- `data/interim/` → cleaned CSVs or notebooks that you regenerate often and want to share with collaborators

These subdirectories start empty except for `.gitkeep` placeholders. Delete the placeholders when you add your real datasets.
