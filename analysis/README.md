# Analysis Exports

Use this folder to store the outputs generated by your notebooks or data pipelines. The conversion scripts never write here automatically, so you decide how to structure it.

Suggested layout:

```
analysis/exports/
├── latest -> run-2025-01-03      # symlink to the snapshot currently in use
└── run-2025-01-03/               # frozen export with CSV/SVG/PNG assets
```

Workflow idea:

1. Generate exploratory results into `analysis/exports/latest`.
2. When the numbers and figures are approved, rename the folder to `run-YYYY-MM-DD` and point `latest` to it.
3. Promote the final figures with `python scripts/analysis/publish_figures.py --article article-template.md`.

Remove the `.gitkeep` file once you add real exports.
