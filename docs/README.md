# Documentation Hub

This directory now contains lightweight references that you can extend to fit any article project.

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `../README.md` | Quick start guide and project overview |
| `docs/journal-guide-template.md` | Template to document target venues and submission requirements |

Feel free to add more guides (style manuals, onboarding checklists, notebook instructions…) as your template evolves. When you do, update this index so contributors immediately know where to look.
