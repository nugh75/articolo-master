# General Summary: The Use of Artificial Intelligence in Educational Contexts

## 🎯 Introduction

This analysis examined the adoption and use of artificial intelligence in educational settings through a sample of 727 participants, divided into four main groups: secondary school students (96 participants), university students (174 participants), pre-service teachers (97 participants), and in-service teachers (360 participants). The survey explored not only the diffusion of AI use (measured through dichotomous Yes/No questions), but also the intensity of use (weekly hours dedicated), allowing for the identification of distinctive patterns among the different groups and subgroups analyzed.

## 📊 GENERAL OVERVIEW: AI Adoption

### The Great Divide: Study vs Teaching

The first finding that emerges strongly from the analysis is the existence of a **clear differentiation** between the world of students and that of teachers. 75% of students (considering both secondary and university students together) report using artificial intelligence for their studies, while among teachers this percentage drops dramatically to 41%. This difference of 34 percentage points is not only statistically significant (p < 0.001, χ² = 76.82), but represents a phenomenon of substantial practical and educational relevance, as evidenced by the effect size (Cramér's V = 0.325).

This division is not limited to simple adoption: the **intensity of use** also reflects the same pattern. Students dedicate an average of 3.9 hours per week to AI use, almost double the 1.9 hours per week of teachers (statistically significant difference: p < 0.001, t = 4.74, Cohen's d = 0.365). We are therefore faced with a double gap: students are not only more numerous in using AI, but when they do, they do so with greater intensity and regularity.

## 🔍 HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE FOUR GROUPS

### A Differentiated Landscape

Looking at the details of the four subgroups, an even more articulated and interesting landscape emerges. Statistical analysis confirms that the four groups differ in a **highly significant** way both in usage proportions (χ² = 51.19, p < 0.001) and in weekly hours dedicated (ANOVA F = 18.25, p < 0.001). However, these differences are not uniformly distributed across all groups.

### Secondary School Students: The "Power Users"

The group that stands out most markedly is that of **secondary school students**. With 79% of AI users and an average of 6.4 hours per week of use, this group represents the population segment with the most massive adoption and the most intensive use of artificial intelligence. Post-hoc tests reveal that the differences between secondary students and all other groups are statistically significant (p < 0.001 in all comparisons), with mean differences ranging from 3.9 to 4.6 hours per week.

This finding is particularly interesting because it suggests that the youngest in the sample (adolescents) have integrated AI into their study routines more pervasively than university students and, even more so, than teachers. We may be witnessing an accelerated generational phenomenon, where familiarity with digital technologies and the absence of pre-existing cultural or methodological barriers facilitate rapid and intense adoption.

### The Other Groups: A Plateau of Moderate Use

In contrast, the other three groups – university students, pre-service teachers, and in-service teachers – form a relatively homogeneous cluster. Post-hoc comparisons do not show significant differences between these groups in weekly hours of use: all settle around 2-2.5 hours per week, with adoption rates varying between 50% and 60%. This unexpected homogeneity between university students and teachers suggests that, beyond adolescence and/or entering the university or professional context, AI use tends to stabilize at more moderate and, perhaps, more reflective or contextualized levels.

## 👥 GENDER AND DISCIPLINARY AREA: Secondary Factors

### The (Surprising) Irrelevance of Gender

One of the most counter-intuitive results of the analysis concerns the **marginal role of gender** in the use of artificial intelligence. Despite widespread narratives about possible gender gaps in technological and digital skills, the data show a completely different picture: in none of the four groups do significant differences emerge between males and females in the proportions of AI use (all p-values > 0.05 in chi-square tests).

Even when analyzing weekly hours, the pattern is substantially the same: in three out of four groups, no significant differences are recorded. The only exception is pre-service teachers, where males use AI an average of 1 hour more per week than females (p = 0.045). However, this result is borderline and is not confirmed in other groups, suggesting that it could be a phenomenon specific to this subgroup or a sampling fluctuation.

The convergence of results between tests on proportions and those on weekly hours reinforces this conclusion: **gender does not appear to be a predictive factor of AI use** in educational settings. This finding is important because it dismantles possible prejudices and suggests that AI adoption occurs transversally with respect to gender, at least in the Italian context analyzed.

### Disciplinary Area: Weak and Inconsistent Effects

The **disciplinary area** (STEM vs Humanities) also emerges as a factor of limited influence. While one might expect that students and teachers in STEM disciplines, due to their greater familiarity with technologies, would use AI more intensively, the data do not confirm this hypothesis consistently.

In usage proportions, only one group shows a significant difference: pre-service teachers in the STEM area use AI less than their colleagues in the humanities area (p = 0.046). This result is counter-intuitive and could reflect specificities of the subgroup or the training received. In weekly hours, instead, no group shows significant differences between STEM and Humanities.

Again, the conclusion is clear: **disciplinary area is not a robust predictor of AI use**. This suggests that artificial intelligence is perceived and used as a transversal tool, applicable to different disciplines and contexts, rather than as a "niche" technology reserved for certain areas of knowledge.

## 🧩 INTERPRETATION AND REFLECTIONS

### 1. The Generational Paradox: Students Lead, Teachers Follow

The most relevant and, in some ways, concerning result of this analysis is the **substantial gap between students and teachers** in the adoption and use of AI. Students, particularly those in secondary school, are massively integrating artificial intelligence into their study practices, while teachers remain more cautious or less involved. This creates a potential **educational misalignment**: students use tools that their teachers may not know or may not use with the same intensity.

This phenomenon raises several issues:
- **Asymmetric competencies**: If students use AI for 6-7 hours per week and teachers only for 2, who possesses the competencies to guide critical and conscious use of these tools?
- **Understanding gap**: Teachers may not be fully aware of how students use AI, making it difficult to design educational activities that integrate or regulate this use.
- **Missed opportunities**: If AI is used primarily outside the formal educational context, the opportunity to integrate these tools in a pedagogically grounded way is lost.

### 2. The Democratization of AI: Beyond Gender and Discipline

The second relevant result is the **transversality of adoption**. The fact that gender and disciplinary area have minimal or no influence suggests that artificial intelligence is becoming a "democratic" tool, accessible and used by different profiles. This is a positive signal, as it indicates that there are no access barriers related to individual or disciplinary characteristics.

However, this democratization also raises questions about the **quality of use**: if everyone uses AI regardless of their specific preparation, who ensures that the use is critical, conscious, and ethically grounded? Widespread diffusion could hide superficial, uncritical, or problematic uses (such as AI-assisted plagiarism or total delegation of cognitive tasks).

### 3. Adolescents as "Early Adopters": Opportunities and Risks

The fact that **secondary school students** are the biggest users of AI is a phenomenon that deserves particular attention. On one hand, this can be seen as a sign of adaptability and openness to new technologies by younger generations. On the other hand, it raises concerns:
- **Critical maturity**: Do adolescents have the critical skills to evaluate the reliability of AI-provided responses? Can they recognize hallucinations, biases, limitations?
- **Cognitive dependency**: Such intensive use (6+ hours per week) could create forms of dependency or cognitive delegation, reducing the development of autonomous problem-solving and critical thinking skills?
- **Educational supervision**: Who accompanies these young people in their use of AI? If teachers use it less, the risk is that use occurs without adequate pedagogical supervision.

### 4. The (Still to be Defined) Role of AI in Teaching

The finding that only 41% of teachers use AI in teaching, with an average of about 2 hours per week, suggests that **the integration of AI into teaching practice is still in its early stages**. This could depend on several factors:
- **Insufficient training**: Teachers may not have received adequate training on the pedagogical use of AI.
- **Regulatory and ethical uncertainties**: The absence of clear guidelines could hinder adoption for fear of violating plagiarism or assessment standards.
- **Cultural resistance**: Part of the teaching staff may perceive AI as a threat to traditional teaching rather than as an opportunity.

Whatever the cause, the result is a **delay in institutional integration** of AI, which risks leaving students alone in exploring these tools.

## 🚀 IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Educational Policies

1. **Teacher training**: It is urgent to invest in teacher training on the pedagogical use of AI, not only as users but as designers of educational experiences that integrate these tools critically.

2. **Institutional guidelines**: Clear guidelines on the use of AI in assessment, teaching, and study need to be defined, to prevent uncertainty from blocking innovation or favoring problematic uses.

3. **AI education for students**: Integrate "AI literacy" pathways into curricula that teach students not only to use AI, but to understand it, critically evaluate it, and use it ethically.

### For Future Research

1. **Qualitative studies**: This quantitative analysis should be integrated with qualitative studies that explore *how* and *why* students and teachers use AI, which applications they prefer, what problems they encounter.

2. **Longitudinal analyses**: It would be interesting to follow the evolution of these patterns over time to understand whether the gap between students and teachers will narrow or widen.

3. **Focus on secondary students**: The group of adolescent "power users" deserves specific attention to better understand the dynamics, benefits, and risks of such intensive use.

## 📌 CONCLUSIONS

The analysis of data on the use of artificial intelligence in educational settings reveals a complex and, in some ways, paradoxical picture. On one hand, we are witnessing a **democratization of access**: AI is used transversally, without significant barriers related to gender or disciplinary area. On the other hand, a very marked **generational and role gap** emerges: students, especially the youngest, have integrated AI into their study practices with an intensity that is not matched among teachers.

This misalignment poses important challenges for the education system. If students massively use tools that their teachers know less about, who guides the development of critical skills? Who educates for conscious and responsible use? The risk is that AI becomes an **educational "gray zone"**, used intensively but without adequate supervision or pedagogical integration.

At the same time, the data also suggest an **opportunity**: students' interest in and familiarity with AI represent a resource to build upon. Rather than resisting or ignoring this phenomenon, the education system could try to intercept it, guide it, and valorize it, transforming students from mere users into *co-designers* of AI-enhanced learning experiences.

The challenge for the near future will be to **bridge the gap** between the spontaneous and intense adoption by students and the pedagogically grounded integration by teachers and educational institutions. Only in this way can artificial intelligence truly become a tool for educational empowerment, rather than a technology used uncritically or, worse, a factor of further inequality between those who know how to use it critically and those who do not.
