# Source Materials

Organize every piece of research material required to draft your article inside this folder.

Suggested layout:

- `sources/presentations/` → slide decks or talk transcripts you want to keep handy
- `sources/notes/` → outlines, interviews, brainstorming snippets, meeting notes
- `sources/extracted/` → parsed tables, spreadsheets or text extracted from slides/audio

All three folders are tracked with placeholder files only, so you can remove the `.gitkeep` files once you start adding real content. Nothing inside `sources/` is processed automatically, so feel free to add more folders that match your workflow.
